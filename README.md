# Player App
## Program created in Java

I created a program that allows the user to enter data. They are then saved to the database and can later be loaded
from the database.
My idea was to enroll football players but it doesn't have to be the case, the user can easily change the
application of the program as it suits him.
</br>
</br>
When entering data, the user must enter the name, surname and age of the player, i.e. I called it PLAYER INFO. After that , there is
a part called CLUB INFO in which user selects the competition league in the drop-down menu and writes the name of the club for which
the player performs. In the end, the user completes the CONTRACT INFO containing details regarding the length of the contract and the 
salary.

## Menu bar layout
There are three options in the menu bar: *File, Server and View*. </br>

</p>
After clicking on *FILE*, user can choose one of three opened menu items: *Save, Import and Exit* </br>
If the user wants to save the data to a file, he will select SAVE, and if he wants to display the data again later, he will select 
IMPORT. If he wants to shut down the program, he'll select EXIT. </br>
In the *SERVER menu*, the user has the option to store the current data on the server, i.e. the database, but also to download and 
display data from the database itself. </br>
In the *VIEW menu*, the user has the option to open a new pop-up window by clicking *Show player info*. It shows player information 
stored in the database. </br>

The window consists of four buttons and a data view.
