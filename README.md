# Player App
## Program created in Java

I created a program that allows the user to enter data. They are then saved to the database and can later be loaded
from the database.
My idea was to enroll football players but it doesn't have to be the case, the user can easily change the
application of the program as it suits him.

When entering data, the user must enter the name, surname and age of the player, i.e. I called it PLAYER INFO. He
then has a part called CLUB INFO in which he selects the competition league in the drop-down menu and writes the
name of the club for which the player performs. In the end, the user completes the CONTRACT INFO containing
details regarding the length of the contract and the salary.
